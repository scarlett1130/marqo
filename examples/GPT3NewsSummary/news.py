        'Title': 'M&S warns of \'gathering storm\' as shoppers squeezed',
        'Description': 'Marks and Spencer has warned of a "gathering storm" of higher costs for retailers and pressure on household budgets as it reported a fall in profits for the first half of the year. The High Street giant said trading would become "more challenging" after it revealed its profits dropped by 24%. It said "all parts" of retail would be affected by the UK\'s economic climate, adding unviable firms would go bust. But M&S said its business could "prove more resilient" due to its clientele. Many UK businesses are being hit by rising energy bills, wage costs and raw materials prices. Consumers are also cutting back their spending, with the Bank of England warning the UK is facing its longest recession since records began. M&S said the "combined impacts of the cost-of-living squeeze" and the increased cost of doing business was "creating pressure on margins industry-wide".'

"I\'m not here to ask any of you to love the people of my country with the same passion as I do," Mr Davis told leaders. "I\'m asking what is it worth to you to have millions of climate refugees to turn into tens of millions, putting pressure on political and economic systems around the world,\" he said.'

The first mass lay-offs in the firm\'s history will result in 11,000 employees, from a worldwide headcount of 87,000, losing their jobs. Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the cuts were "the most difficult changes we\'ve made in Meta\'s history". The news follows major lay-offs at Twitter, which cut about half its staff, and other tech firms. "I know this is tough for everyone, and I\'m especially sorry to those impacted," he wrote in a statement. Mr Zuckerberg blamed massive long-term expectations for growth based on the firm\'s rise in revenue during the pandemic.'

        'Description': 'As voters across the US wake up on Wednesday morning after the election, the results of the 2022 midterms are not yet completely clear - with officials across the country warning that elections may drag on for days or weeks. The expected delays are the result of a number of factors, including razor-thin margins between candidates, potentially contested elections, the possibility of recounts and even a likely run-off in Georgia - a key Senate battleground. Other delays will be due to the decentralised way in which elections are set up in the US, in which states have varied rules for how mail-in ballots are counted, and when. Live: Latest updates as contest goes to the wire. The issue of delays has been a politically contentious one since the 2020 presidential election, when then-President Donald Trump attempted to claim victory the following morning while votes were still being tallied, declaring continued voting counting a "fraud" and an "embarrassment".',

        'Description': 'Results are being declared in the US midterm elections, with control of Congress hanging in the balance. Republicans are likely to take control of the House of Representatives but the Senate fight is on a knife-edge. The race for the Senate seat in Georgia, which could determine the outcome, will not be decided until a runoff election on 6 December. The contest there between Republican Herschel Walker and Democrat Raphael Warnock is too close to call. Democrat John Fetterman, who suffered a stroke in May, defeated his Republican opponent Mehmet Oz to flip a key Senate seat in Pennsylvania. But the results of two other races that will decide the contest have yet to be called - in Nevada and Arizona. If Democrats lose control of either chamber of Congress, Republicans will be able to block President Joe Biden\'s agenda. Meanwhile Florida\'s Republican governor Ron DeSantis, a possible 2024 presidential contender, has won a large victory to stay in office.',

Elon Musk\'s electric-car manufacturer says the vehicles\' power-steering assist system may fail on rough roads or after hitting a pothole. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it could require greater steering effort, especially at low speeds, increasing crash risks. Tesla has released a software update to recalibrate the system. It was unaware of any injuries or deaths in connection with the problem, it said. However, 314 vehicle alerts have been issued for US vehicles that may be related to the recall. The recall affects the 2017-21 Model S and Model X vehicles.',

"Climate and energy security go hand-in-hand," he said in his first international appearance since taking office. Leaders from 120 countries are meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt to discuss next steps in curbing climate change. Key topics are compensation and support for the most-affected countries. "Putin\'s abhorrent war in Ukraine and rising energy prices across the world are not a reason to go slow on climate change. They are a reason to act faster," Mr Sunak said. "We can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future [...] There really is room for hope," he added.',

The £324 payment would be made directly into bank accounts between now and 23 November, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said. Those who qualify via tax credits will receive it by the end of the month. A first grant of £326 was paid earlier in the year and, together, they are designed to assist with rising bills. When will I get the £400 energy discount? The support, totalling £650, is for those across the UK on certain benefits, including Universal Credit and pension credit. It is the largest part of direct financial assistance from the government to tackle costs such as energy bills. The funds are paid directly into the same accounts used to receive benefits payments, with the reference of the recipients\' national insurance number followed by "DWP COL".',

        'Description': 'Republicans made modest gains in U.S. midterm elections but Democrats performed better than expected, as control of the Senate hinged on three races that remained too close to call on Wednesday afternoon. The Georgia U.S. Senate race between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker will go to a Dec. 6 runoff, Edison Research projected. That means it could be weeks until control of that chamber is known, unless Democrats hold off challengers in Nevada and Arizona. Republicans picked up at least seven seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, Edison Research projected. That would be two more than needed to wrest control of the chamber from Democrats, though with 45 races still uncalled, the Republican margin could go up or down. But they appeared to be far short of the sweeping "red wave" victory they had sought, as Democrats were avoiding the kind of heavy midterm defeat that often plagues sitting presidents of either party. The results appeared to show voters punishing Biden for presiding over an economy hit by steep inflation, while also lashing out against Republican efforts to ban abortion and cast doubt on the nation\'s vote-counting process.'

        'Description': 'Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares slid to their lowest level in nearly two years on Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk sold $3.95 billion worth of shares in the electric-vehicle maker. The shares were down 6.1% at $179.66 in afternoon trading. Musk\'s latest share sale fueled jitters about the fallout of his Twitter buy on the world\'s most valuable automaker, analysts said. The billionaire\'s recent acquisition of Twitter sparked investor concerns including whether he would be distracted from running Tesla or divert resources to the social media company. Some investors also feared the possible impact on Tesla\'s sales and brand as well as potential pressure on Tesla from countries trying to control online speech. The latest sale brings the total amount of Tesla stock sold by Musk since last November to about $36 billion - despite his having said earlier that he would sell no more of his shares.'

The specific employees losing their jobs will be informed over the course of the morning, the report said. Meta\'s head of human resources, Lori Goler, said employees who lose their jobs will be provided with at least four months of salary as severance, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Disney+ has attracted millions of subscribers and will launch an ad-supported tier next month, but executives\' promise of profitability next year and forecast for operating results in the next quarter failed to impress. The company missed analysts\' expectations for fourth-quarter earnings, after a $1.5 billion loss in its streaming division. "Disney\'s streaming results are indicative of the tightrope it is walking," said Fred Boxa, associate director at consulting firm Arthur D. Little. Finance chief Christine McCarthy, in a call with analysts on Tuesday, said the ad tier was not expected to meaningfully impact results until later in the financial year.'

Masdar, which has a portfolio of renewable energy assets with a combined value of more than $20 billion and a total capacity of more than 15 GW, said the new project would be its biggest yet. The 10 GW farm would produce 47,790 GWh of clean energy annually and offset 23.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to around 9% of Egypt\'s current CO2 emissions."With this agreement to develop our largest ever project, Masdar is proud to bolster our contribution to Egypt\'s renewable energy goals," Masdar\'s CEO Mohamed Jameel al-Ramahi said.'

        'Description': 'Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday heard arguments over whether states can require corporations to consent to the jurisdiction of their courts when they register to do business in the state, in a case that could dramatically expand state courts\' jurisdiction over corporations around the country. The dispute arises from a petition by Virginia resident Robert Mallory, who asked the nation\'s top court to revive his lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court against his former employer, Virginia-based Norfolk Southern Railway Co, claiming he developed colon cancer because of asbestos exposure on the job. Pennsylvania had a statute requiring companies to consent to its courts\' jurisdiction when they register to do business there. Norfolk Southern, one of the nation\'s largest railway operators, maintained that the law violates its due process rights under the U.S. Constitution\'s 14th Amendment. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed, affirming the trial court\'s dismissal of Mallory\'s case. "Fidelity to the original public meaning of the 14th Amendment in this case means that the flesh-and-blood little guy wins and the Fortune 500 company loses," Ashley Keller of Keller Postman, a lawyer for Mallory, told the justices on Tuesday, urging them to reverse.'
