# Release 0.0.6

## New features
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health`. An endpoint that can be used to inspect the status of Marqo and Marqo's backend (Marqo-os)
- Marqo can be launched with environment variables that define limits around maximum number of fields per index, maximum document size and the maximum numnber of documents that can be retrieved.
- README translations: 
  - Chinese ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ (by [@wanliAlex](https://github.com/wanliAlex))
  - French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· (by [@rym-oualha](https://github.com/rym-oualha))
  - Ukrainian ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ (by [@dmyzlata](https://github.com/dmyzlata))

## Breaking API changes
The home `/` json response has been updated. If you have logic that reads the endpoint root, please update it. 

## Non-breaking data model changes
- Each text field just creates a top level Marqo-os text field, without any keywords 
- Very large fields get their tensor_facet keywords ignored, rather than Marqo-OS preventing the doc being indexed
- Tensor facets can no longer have _id as a filtering field

## Bug fixes and minor changes
- FastAPI single threaded concurrency
- Refactoring out old code
- Get documents by IDs and lexical search and no longer returns vectors if expose_facets isn't specified

## Caveats
- If a large request to add_documents or update_documents results in a document adding fields such that the index field limit is exceeded, the entire operation will fail (without resilience). Mitigate this sending `add_documents` and `update_documents` requests with smaller batches of documents. 
- Fixing asynchronous indexing means that large scale ingestion can overwhelm Marqo's resources (this dependent on the machine running Marqo). For ingesting large batches of data we recommend: 
  - server side batch size of 10
  - client side batch size of 10 - 50
